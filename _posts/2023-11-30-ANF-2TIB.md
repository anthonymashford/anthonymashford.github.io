## Microsoft Announces Azure NetApp Files 2TiB Capacity Pools

Today Microsoft announced an update to Azure NetApp Files, 2TiB capacity pools are now generally available. However, there is a small caveat that Standard Network features is a requirement to use 2TiB capacity pools.

Microsoft has has also introduced a new feature that allows customers to create capacity pools with a minimum size of 1TiB (Public Preview). However, it’s important to note that these smaller pools also require standard network features. This means that customers can start with a minimum pool size of 1TiB and increase it with 1 TiB increments. For capacities less than 2 TiB, this Azure update saves money by allowing customers to re-evaluate volume planning to take advantage of savings of smaller capacity pools. It’s worth noting that this feature is supported in all regions with standard network features.
