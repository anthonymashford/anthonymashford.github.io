Microsoft has has also introduced a new feature that allows customers to create capacity pools with a minimum size of 1TiB (public Preview). However, it’s important to note that these smaller pools also require standard network features. This means that customers can start with a minimum pool size of 1TiB and increase it with 1 TiB increments.
