## Microsoft Azure Elastic SAN is now GA

Recently Microsoft announced that Azure Elastic SAN is now generally available. 

## Overview
 
Azure Elastic SAN (Storage Area Network) is a cloud-native service offered by Microsoft. Here's an overview:

**Purpose**: Azure Elastic SAN is designed to optimise workloads and the integration between large scale databases and performance-intensive mission-critical applications.

**Interoperability**: It works with multiple types of compute resources such as Azure Virtual Machines, Azure VMware Solutions, and Azure Kubernetes Service.

**Compatibility**: Azure Elastic SAN volumes can connect to a wide variety of compute resources using the internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) protocol.

**Simplified Provisioning and Management**: Elastic SAN simplifies deploying and managing storage at scale through grouping and policy enforcement.

**Performance**: With an Elastic SAN, it's possible to scale your performance up to millions of IOPS, with double-digit GB/s throughput, and have single-digit millisecond latency.

**Cost Optimization and Consolidation**: Cost optimization can be achieved with Elastic SAN since you can increase your SAN storage in bulk.

**Resources**: Each Azure Elastic SAN has two internal resources: Volume groups and volumes.

## Creating a SAN Instance

1. Login to the Azure portal and browse for **Elastic SAN**
2. On the Elastic SAN blade, click **Create**

4. On the **Networking** page, choose whether or not you want to enable **Public** access. Exercise caution at this point, as enabling public access will make your Elastic SAN instance accessible over the Internet. Once completed, click **Next**

9. On the next page, click **Create**
10. Then, click **Next**
11. On the **Volume** page, name your volume and choose its size (in GiB). Click **Next**

## Summary
Azure Elastic SAN (Storage Area Network) is a cloud-native service that offers a scalable, cost-effective, high-performance, and comprehensive storage solution for a range of compute options. It provides an end-to-end experience similar to on-premises SAN.

It extends storage support beyond Azure Virtual Machines to include Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure VMware Solution, cloud-native applications, and edge appliances through industry standard interface iSCSI protocols. It also offers high levels of resiliency without having to set up multiple deployments of SAN arrays and a replication policy.

So, what are you waiting for, get logged into Azure and have a go at setting up your own Elastic SAN instance ðŸ˜Š
