# **Why Storage-Driven Migrations to Azure Matter More Than Ever**

As organisations accelerate their journey to the cloud, one truth remains clear: **data is at the heart of digital transformation**. Yet too often, cloud migrations start with applications rather than the foundation that supports them ‚Äî storage.

That‚Äôs where **Azure NetApp Files** comes in. As a Microsoft Azure native, first-party storage service, Azure NetApp Files provides the **high performance, low latency, and enterprise-grade reliability** needed to make storage-driven migrations seamless. It enables customers to move even their most demanding workloads ‚Äî such as SAP, Oracle, or virtual desktop environments ‚Äî to Azure with confidence.

When data moves first, applications can follow faster, perform better, and modernise more effectively. Here‚Äôs why storage-driven migrations to Azure are so important.

---

## üåç **Data Gravity: The Core of Every Workload**

Applications can‚Äôt function without their data. Whether you‚Äôre running SAP, Oracle, or high-performance databases, workloads depend on fast, reliable access to information.

By moving storage to Azure first, organisations ensure:

* Data is **co-located** with compute resources for reduced latency.
* Applications can be **lifted and shifted** or modernised more easily.
* Dependencies between storage and app layers remain intact.

In short, storage migration enables everything else ‚Äî it‚Äôs the anchor for application mobility.

---

## üèéÔ∏è **Performance That Matches (or Exceeds) On-Premises**

Azure‚Äôs portfolio of storage solutions ‚Äî including **Azure NetApp Files** ‚Äî delivers the scale and performance enterprises need.

Storage-driven migrations allow IT teams to validate:

* **Throughput and latency** that meet or exceed on-premises performance.
* **File-based protocol support** (NFS, SMB, dual-protocol).
* **High-performance workloads** such as databases, HPC, and analytics.

This ensures a smooth transition for mission-critical workloads without compromise.

---

## üí∞ **Smarter Cost Optimisation**

Migrating storage provides visibility into how data is used, helping teams optimise for both performance and cost. With Azure services, organisations can:

* **Tier data** using lifecycle policy.
* **Consolidate** siloed infrastructure into native Azure native storage services.
* **Reduce CapEx and OpEx** by resizing down or retiring legacy hardware.

With **Azure NetApp Files‚Äô flexible pricing and capacity pool model**, businesses can right-size their environment and pay only for what they need.

---

## ü¶∫ **Built-In Resilience and Protection**

Storage migration isn‚Äôt just about moving data ‚Äî it‚Äôs about securing it. Azure NetApp Files makes it simple to protect and recover data through:

* **Snapshot policies** for near-instant restore.
* **Cross-Region Replication** for disaster recovery.
* **Azure Backup Vault integration** for long-term data protection.

By establishing these safeguards during migration, organisations ensure business continuity from day one.

---

## üÜï **Foundation for Modernisation**

Once data resides in Azure, it becomes the foundation for modernisation and innovation.

With Azure-native data, organisations can:

* Integrate with **Azure AI and analytics** services.
* Streamline pipelines with **Microsoft Fabric** and **Synapse Analytics**.
* Build **hybrid or multi-cloud** architectures with consistent management.

Storage isn‚Äôt just infrastructure ‚Äî it‚Äôs the enabler of next-generation digital services.

---

## üìÜ **Reduced Migration Complexity**

By focusing first on storage, organisations can simplify migration workflows and reduce downtime.
A storage-first approach means:

* You can **decouple data movement** from application refactoring.
* **Staged migrations** (data first, then apps) are easier to manage.
* Testing, validation, and cutover become more predictable.

This makes storage-driven migrations a safer, more controlled path to the cloud.

---

## **The Takeaway**

Storage-driven migrations to Azure are more than a technical step ‚Äî they‚Äôre a **strategic enabler** for cloud success.

By leveraging **Azure NetApp Files**, organisations gain enterprise-grade performance, efficiency, and protection while laying the groundwork for modernization. In a world where data powers every decision and innovation, **starting with storage isn‚Äôt just smart ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential.**

---

### **Summary**

* **Data first, workloads next:** Migrating storage lays the foundation for seamless application movement.
* **Enterprise performance:** Azure NetApp Files delivers on-premises-class speed and low latency.
* **Optimised costs:** Tier, consolidate, and scale storage efficiently.
* **Built-in protection:** Simplify disaster recovery and compliance with native Azure tools.
* **Modernisation-ready:** Unlock AI, analytics, and cloud-native innovation with data already in Azure.
