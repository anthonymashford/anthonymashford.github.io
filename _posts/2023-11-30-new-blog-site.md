## Welcome to AzureTechLab
My new blog is about to providing you with the latest insights and updates on Azure services, infrastructure-as-code, and more. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned cloud professional or just starting out, I hope my new blog has something for you.

I mostly blog about Azure resources such as Azure Compute, Networking and Storage, specifically Azure NetApp Files.

I hope you find this site and its contents interesting and useful ðŸ˜Š
