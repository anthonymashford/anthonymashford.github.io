## *Because “my storage is highly available” shouldn’t mean “I have a spreadsheet of failover runbooks and a nervous twitch.”*

---

Azure NetApp Files has a newly introduced **Elastic zone-redundant storage** service level that brings **built-in multi–availability zone (multi-AZ) high availability** directly into the service—so you can ride out an **entire zone** going offline without bolting on external replication or managing “secondary volumes” yourself.

I’ll put it like this: Elastic is for the moments when the business says *“we need this file service to keep working”* and you’d like your answer to be something other than *nervous laughter(*.

---

## What is Elastic zone-redundant storage?

Elastic is an **advanced high-availability** service level designed for **continuous data access with zero data loss**, even if a whole Azure Availability Zone becomes unavailable.

A useful mental model:

* **Classic approach:** “I’ll deploy in one zone and then replicate somewhere else, manage failover, test it, maintain it…”
* **Elastic approach:** “The service is already multi-AZ and handles zone failure within the platform.”

Also worth noting: Microsoft’s documentation describes the Elastic service level as running on Azure infrastructure with **built-in zone redundancy** and **low single-digit millisecond latency**.

---

## How it works (the reasonably technical bit)

Elastic uses **zone-redundant architecture with synchronous replication** at the file storage layer.

### Writes: “two (or three) copies before I say ‘OK’”

When your application writes data, Azure NetApp Files **writes the data across availability zones before acknowledging the write-back**—so each zone’s copy stays identical.

### Reads: “pick a home zone for performance”

You can choose a **preferred (active) zone** to align storage with compute and reduce read latency, while keeping **seamless failover** if that zone disappears for a while.

### The headline benefit

It “bakes in” zone resilience so you don’t need to stitch together availability with external replication and secondary volume management.

---

## Where it’s currently supported

At the time of writing, Microsoft lists these supported regions for Elastic zone-redundant storage: **Australia East, Canada Central, Central US, South Central US, West Europe, West US 3**.

Also: some regions may only have **two** availability zones available for this feature, so it’s recommended to confirm what’s supported before deployment.

---

## Getting started (high-level workflow)

### 1) Create a NetApp Elastic account (this is important)

Elastic requires a **NetApp account explicitly designated** for Elastic zone-redundant storage—and that account is **only** for Elastic.

### 2) Create an Elastic capacity pool and set zone preferences

Elastic capacity pools let you define a **failover preference order** (up to three zones, depending on the region).

Microsoft also calls out checking zone support using the REST API:

```text
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/locations/{location}/elasticRegionInfo?api-version=2025-09-01-preview
```

### 3) Create volumes (NFS or SMB) as usual

From there, it’s the familiar Azure NetApp Files experience: pick the pool, name the volume, set quota, and configure snapshot policy / advanced options as needed.

### 4) Tooling notes

Microsoft recommends using the **latest Azure CLI** / **latest Az.NetAppFiles PowerShell module** for Elastic-related operations.

And if you’re using custom roles with availability zones, ensure your RBAC permissions are correct to avoid portal issues.

---

## Workloads that make Elastic feel like cheating (in a good way)

Microsoft calls out Elastic as well-suited for **metadata-heavy workloads** across VMs and containers, including **AI, analytics, and Kubernetes/OpenShift environments**, plus **general file shares**.

It’s also positioned for regulated/critical industries that want “always-on” storage availability without home-grown DR scripts.

---

## Practical limits and “nerdy bits” to be aware of

A few Elastic-specific limits from Microsoft’s published resource limits include:

* **Capacity pool size:** 1 TiB min, 128 TiB max
* **Volume size:** 1 GiB min, 16 TiB max
* **Volumes per pool:** 50
* **Snapshots per volume:** 255

### `maxfiles` (inode) planning

Elastic volumes have a default inode ceiling based on volume size; Microsoft notes **each inode requires 32 KB of space**, and provides example `maxfiles` values (e.g., **1 TiB ≈ 31.8M**, **10 TiB ≈ 318.7M**).

---

## Zone resilience isn’t the same as regional DR

Elastic is about surviving a **zone** outage *inside a region*. For truly catastrophic **regional** scenarios, Microsoft’s broader storage guidance notes that **ZRS alone might not fully protect against a regional disaster**.

So for end-to-end resilience, you may still pair Elastic with a **second-region strategy** (for example, Azure NetApp Files supports cross-zone and cross-region replication features—depending on your requirements).

---

## Summary

If your goal is **“keep the file service online even if a whole zone goes dark”**—and you want to achieve it with fewer moving parts—**Azure NetApp Files Elastic zone-redundant storage** is a big step forward: synchronous multi-AZ writes, preferred-zone performance alignment, and built-in failover behavior.
