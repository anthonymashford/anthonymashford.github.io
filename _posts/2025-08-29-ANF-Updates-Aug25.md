## üöÄ Short-term Clones (Preview)

Short-term clones in Azure NetApp Files provide **space-efficient, instant read/write access** to data by creating temporary thin clones from existing volume snapshots. This eliminates the need for full data copies and enables significant capacity savings.

**Key Benefits:**

- Ideal for software development, analytics, disaster recovery, and testing
- Supports large datasets with quick refreshes from the latest snapshots
- Temporary and space-efficient for up to one month
- Consumes capacity only for incremental changes

This feature accelerates development and analytics workflows, improves quality and resilience, and reduces costs. Now available in preview across all Azure NetApp Files supported regions.

## üíæ Backup Support for Large Volumes (Preview)

Azure NetApp Files backup now supports **large volumes** by moving point-in-time snapshot copy data to **low-cost Azure storage**. This addresses long-term retention, data protection, and compliance needs.

**Highlights:**

- Efficient data protection for initial and incremental backups
- Registration required to use this feature

## üîÑ Restore Individual Files Using Single-File Restore (Preview)

With **single-file restore from backup**, you can now restore individual files from the Azure NetApp Files backup vault without restoring the entire volume.

**Advantages:**

- Save time and cost by restoring only necessary files
- Now available in preview

## üìä File Access Logs ‚Äì Now Generally Available (GA)

File access logs provide **enterprise-grade visibility** into file-level operations across SMB3, NFSv4.1, and dual-protocol volumes.

**Use Cases:**

- Monitor access patterns
- Detect unauthorised activity
- Support compliance investigations
- Optimise data usage

This feature enhances security and operational insight, aligning with the Well-Architected Framework's best practices.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Flexible Service Level with Cool Access (Preview)

Azure NetApp Files now supports **cool access** for the Flexible service level, enabling automatic tiering of infrequently accessed data to **lower-cost Azure storage**.

**Benefits:**

- Optimise performance and cost
- Decouple storage capacity and throughput
- Maintain configured throughput levels with cool access

**Note:** Registration is required for the Flexible service level before enrolling in this preview.
